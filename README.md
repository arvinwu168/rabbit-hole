# Arbor

Arbor is a desktop-first prototype for tree-structured AI conversations. Each chat is a recursive tree: the main pane renders the path to the active node, while the sidebar lets you move between sibling ideas without flattening them into one timeline.

## Prototype features

- Recursive, filesystem-style chat navigation
- Root-to-active conversation paths
- Raw branches from any assistant turn
- Quote-anchored branches created from selected response text
- Simulated word-by-word streaming through a Next.js route handler
- Local persistence with a seeded demonstration tree
- One-click reset to the demo state

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Production check

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

The current `/api/chat` route is intentionally mocked. It is the seam where an OpenAI provider or Vercel AI Gateway can be connected later without changing the tree interaction model.
